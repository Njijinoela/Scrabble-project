    </section>
        <p class="p">Scrabble is a classic word game where players score points by forming words from
        individual letter tiles on a game board.<br>Each letter tile has a point value, and players arrange these tiles on a 15x15
        grid to create words, much like a crossword puzzle.<br>The goal is to score the most points by creating high-scoring words,
        often by taking advantage of bonus squares on the board (like double or triple letter/word scores).
        <br>The game combines vocabulary, strategy, and sometimes luck with the letter tiles drawn.</p>
        
        <p class="p">Here is a detailed tutorial for the game....</p>
